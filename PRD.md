# Claude Code + Neovim Integration - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Claude Code operates independently of text editors, making file changes that users need to manually track and review. When using Neovim as the primary editor, developers miss real-time visibility of Claude Code's modifications, leading to workflow friction and potential confusion about what changes are being made.

### Solution
A bidirectional integration system that bridges Claude Code and Neovim, providing real-time file change synchronization, diff previews, and interactive change acceptance/rejection capabilities.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Real-time Sync**: Instantly reflect Claude Code's file modifications in Neovim
- **Change Visibility**: Show pending changes before they're written to disk
- **User Control**: Allow accepting/rejecting changes from within Neovim
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration without disrupting existing workflows

### Success Metrics
- < 100ms latency between Claude Code action and Neovim notification
- Zero data loss during synchronization
- Support for multiple simultaneous file changes
- Works with existing Neovim configurations without conflicts

## 3. User Stories

### As a Developer
1. **I want to** see Claude Code's proposed changes in my Neovim buffer **so that** I can review them before they're applied
2. **I want to** accept or reject changes individually **so that** I maintain control over my codebase
3. **I want to** see a diff view of changes **so that** I understand what's being modified
4. **I want to** have syntax highlighting preserved **so that** changes are easy to read
5. **I want to** continue using Neovim normally **so that** my workflow isn't disrupted

### As a Power User
1. **I want to** configure which files are auto-reloaded **so that** I can customize the behavior
2. **I want to** see change history **so that** I can track what Claude Code has done
3. **I want to** trigger Claude Code actions from Neovim **so that** I never leave my editor

## 4. Functional Requirements

- Git integration for version control awareness

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Latency**: < 100ms for change detection
- **Memory**: < 50MB additional memory usage
- **CPU**: < 5% CPU usage during monitoring
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ file changes per minute

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during development sessions
- **Recovery**: Automatic reconnection after disconnection
- **Data Integrity**: No file corruption or data loss
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation on errors

### Usability
- **Installation**: Single command installation
- **Configuration**: Sensible defaults, optional customization
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive help within Neovim
- **Learning Curve**: < 5 minutes to start using

### Compatibility
- **Neovim Versions**: 0.8.0+
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
- **Claude Code Versions**: Latest stable release
- **File Systems**: Local and network filesystems

## 6. Technical Constraints

### Dependencies
- Neovim 0.8+ (for Lua 5.1+ support)
- File system watching capability (inotify/fsevents/etc.)
- IPC mechanism (Unix sockets/named pipes)
- Optional: tmux for session management

### Limitations
- Binary file changes not previewed (notification only)
- Large file changes (>10MB) may have delayed preview
- Some Neovim plugins may conflict with auto-reload

## 7. User Interface
